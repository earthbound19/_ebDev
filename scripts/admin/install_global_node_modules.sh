# CODE
packagesList=" \
ttab \
svgo \
buzzphrase \
csv-to-md \
markdown-styles \
gh \
afterwriting \
vanity-eth"

# Other potentially used packages:
# ungit

# NOTE: markdown-styles (I think!) changed name to generate-md and then back.
#  What on earth, nodejs-land? Also, markdown-styles has many dependency
#  and other warnings on install.
