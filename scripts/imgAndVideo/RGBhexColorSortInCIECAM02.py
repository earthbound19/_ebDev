# DESCRIPTION
# Takes a list of RGB colors expressed in hex (one per line) and sorts them 
# using an advanced color appearance model: CIECAM02 / JCh.
# If you're sorting very different colors, YOU MAY WISH to use
# sortSRGBhexColorsColoraide.py sorting in cam16 or various other color spaces instead (see). This uses the colorspacious library; that uses coloraide. rgbHexColorSortInOkLab.js may be blazing fast if you prefer oklab space (which coloraide can also use).

# DEPENDENCIES
# Python (probably Python 3.5), various python packages (see import list at start of code) which you may install with easy_install or pip.

# USAGE
# Run this script through a Python interpreter, with these positional parameters:
# - sys.argv[1] A list of RGB colors as hexadecimal numbers, in .hexplt format (a simple text list, one color per line).
# - sys.argv[2] OPTIONAL. May be anything, and if present, the script will overwrite the original hex palette list with the sorted colors. To use positional parameter 3 (the next one) but not overwrite the original hex palette list, pass this as the string 'NULL' (with or without quote marks).
# - sys.argv[3] OPTIONAL. Any hex color code string in the format '#fa24cf' (RGB color expressed in hex format, surrounded by single quote marks), which the script will use as the first color to compare other colors to. The list will be sorted by next nearest color starting with this arbitrary color. If the color happens to be in the original list file (first argument), it will remain in the final list. If the color is not in the original list, it will not appear in the final sorted list.
# Example run with only a hexplt file given:
#    python /path/to_this_script/RGBhexColorSortInCIECAM02.py PrismacolorMarkers.hexplt
# The result will be printed to stdout, so that you may for example redirect the output to a new .hexplt file, e.g.:
#    python /path/to_this_script/RGBhexColorSortInCIECAM02.py inputColors.hexplt > result.hexplt
# Example run with the optional second parameter, which will cause the script to overwrite the original .hexplt file with the sorted version of it:
#    python /path/to_this_script/RGBhexColorSortInCIECAM02.py inputColors.hexplt foo
# Example run with the optional third parameter, an arbitrary color to start comparisons with (here, magenta):
#    python /path/to_this_script/RGBhexColorSortInCIECAM02.py inputColors.hexplt foo #ff00ff
# NOTES
# - This will delete duplicate colors in the list.
# - The same input always produces the same output, though if you change the order of colors in the list, the results may change. This is because the script uses the first color in the list to begin its comparisons (but you may override that with parameter 3). You therefore may wish to decide which color you want first in the list for those comparison purposes, or pass an arbitrary color via parameter 3.
# - There are more color distance calculations than in JCh which this is hard-coded to. See comments in hex_to_CIECAM02_JCh() function.

BUT FIRST, track (with the following variable, countOfArbitraryFirstColorInOriginalList) the count of that color in the list before we add it to the list, because if that count is zero before adding, we will want to remove it from the list after comparisons and sorting (we don't want to permanently add it to the list; we only want to add it temporarily). (Because we don't want to add colors permanently to the list that were never there; we want to leave the list as it was found.) But if it _was_ originally in the list, we want to keep it there after adding, because the list will be deduplicated. Because the list will be deduplicated, the color we add to the list (even if it was in the list already before we added it) it would end up appearing only once in the list, and removing it after that would remove it entirely. That is a lot of explanation for the following two lines of code :)
