# DESCRIPTION
# Concatenates all video files (default extension .mp4) in a directory into one output file. Source files must all be encoded with the same codec and settings. In contrast to some other scripts here, it makes the list of videos "on the fly"--it will do so with whatever sort the `ls` command outputs.

# KNOWN ISSUES
# See "NOTE" echo at end of script (about super long path/file names).

# DEPENDENCIES
#    ffmpeg, randomString.sh

# USAGE
# Run with these parameters:
# - $1 OPTIONAL. Extension of source video files to concatenate into one larger file. They must all be encoded the same way. If not provided, defaults to mp4.
# - $2 OPTIONAL. File name of list of files. The contents of this file must be in this format:
#    file 'file1.avi'
#    file 'file2.avi'
#    file 'anotherVideoFileName.avi'
#    file 'etcetera.avi'
# If $2 is used, $1 is ignored (and can technically be anything in that case, like the word NULL). It may be desirable to use $2 if you want a custom ordering for the concatenation of the files. If you only use $1, whatever order results from the file list wildcard portion of the printf command in code (see) is the concatenation order.
# Example with only parameter $1:
#    concatVideos.sh avi
# Example without any parameter, which would concatenate all mp4 files, because mp4 is the default if you don't provide a file type:
#    concatVideos.sh
# The result concatenated file name in that case is _mp4sConcatenated.mp4`.
# Example with parameters $1 and $2:
#    concatVideos.sh YORGBLAF fadeSRCvideosList.txt
# NOTES
# This script sets an environment variable $concatenatedVideoFileName which will be set in a calling shell if you call this script this way:
#    source concatVideos.sh YORGBLAF fadeSRCvideosList.txt
# The purpose of setting that variable is to use it in other scripts that need to know the result encoded file name (to do things with it).


# CODE
if [ "$1" ]; then vidExt=$1; else vidExt=mp4; fi
if [ "$2" ]; then srcFileList=$2; fi

if [ ! "$srcFileList" ]
then
	srcFileList="all"_"$vidExt"".txt"
	printf "file '%s'\n" *.$vidExt > $srcFileList
fi

rndString=$(randomString.sh 1 14)
concatenatedVideoFileName=_"$vidExt"sConcatenated_"$rndString"\.$vidExt
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i $srcFileList -c copy $concatenatedVideoFileName

# rm $srcFileList

echo "DONE. See result file $concatenatedVideoFileName and move or copy it where you will. NOTE: If you got an error about not finding all_mp4.txt (or similar), it may be that you're in a folder path and/or you have file names that are far to long, and you need to shorten them and move the folder to the root of a drive and try again."
