# DESCRIPTION
# For correcting date stamps in files in Windows file systems that get into inconsistent or outright wrong states by backups, restores or other file operations. Via `ExifTool`, scans the creation date, modification date, access date, metadata Create Data, and Metadata Date/time stamps (the latter two for image etc. files), then sets the Windows file _creation_ date/time (possibly unique to windows--not in 'nix file systems) to the earliest of these, and the file _modification_ time to the newest of these.

# DEPENDENCIES
# exiftool, sed, head, tail, binarez_touch http://www.binarez.com/touch_dot_exe/ (a copy is in my _ebSuperBin repo).

# USAGE
# Run with the name of a file to so modify the timestamps of it, e.g.:
#    toOldestWindowsDateTime.sh image.jpg
# OR e.g.:
#    toOldestWindowsDateTime.sh source_file.txt
# To do this for every file (regardless of file type) in the current directory, see `allToOldestWindowsDateTime.sh`.


# CODE
if [ -z "$1" ]; then echo "NO source file \$1 passed to script. Exiting."; exit; fi

exiftool $1 > tmp_E8eK.txt
printf "" > tmp2_E8eK5t4aw.txt

# TRANSFORM FOR BINAREZ_TOUCH; comment this out if you use the exiftool option below:
sed -i 's/\([0-9]\{4\}\):\([0-9]\{2\}\):\([0-9]\{2\}\) \([0-9]\{2\}\)/\1-\2-\3T\4/g' tmp2_E8eK5t4aw.txt

sort tmp2_E8eK5t4aw.txt > tmp_E8eK.txt
# redirect output of command to to &>/dev/null to suppress feedback print I don't care about and which clutters up information print when this script is called repeatedly:
dos2unix tmp_E8eK.txt &>/dev/null
createAdjustmentDateStamp=`head -n 1 tmp_E8eK.txt`
modifyAdjustmentDateStamp=`tail -n 1 tmp_E8eK.txt`
rm tmp_E8eK.txt tmp2_E8eK5t4aw.txt

# ---- START EXIFTOOL OPTION--DEPRECATED. IF YOU USE THIS OPTION, uncomment the next two lines of code, comment out the code in the BINAREZ_TOUCH section below, and also comment out the line of code after the "TRANSFORM FOR BINAREZ_TOUCH" comment above. (Do the invert of those instructions if you use binarez_touch.) NOTE: previously this erroneously updated CreateDate, which I believe alters file metadata--but the intent of this script was to modify Windows file system time stamp attributes, which this has been corrected to do via FileCreateDate;
# redirect output of these commands to /dev/null also:
# exiftool -overwrite_original -FileCreateDate=\""$createAdjustmentDateStamp"\" $1 &>/dev/null
# exiftool -overwrite_original -FileModifyDate=\""$modifyAdjustmentDateStamp"\" $1 &>/dev/null
# ---- END EXIFTOOL OPTION

# ---- START BINAREZ_TOUCH OPTION--PREFERRED: this will update time stamps for files that exiftool won't; ex. call binarez_touch 027_cover.jpg -acxv -d 2019-01-18T05:15:32;
# At this writing, the binarez_touch web site seems to have vanished into the aether :( with any reliable source for an executable also; relying on my sole local copy of it in _ebSuperBin. Maybe some equivalent tool that may be around longer is findable.
	# echo createAdjustmentDateStamp is $createAdjustmentDateStamp
binarez_touch $1 -cxv -d $createAdjustmentDateStamp
	# echo modifyAdjustmentDateStamp is $modifyAdjustmentDateStamp
binarez_touch $1 -cmv -d $modifyAdjustmentDateStamp
# ---- END BINAREZ_TOUCH OPTION
