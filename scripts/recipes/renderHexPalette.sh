# DESCRIPTION
# Takes a list of hex color codes, one per line, and renders a PNG image composed of tiles of those colors (a palette image), via other scripts.

# DEPENDENCIES
# - graphicsmagick, hexplt2ppm.sh, img2imgNN.sh
# - Optionally, an environment variable export of EB_PALETTES_ROOT_DIR set in `~/.bashrc` (in your home folder) which contains one line, set with a Unix-style path to the folder where you keep hex palette (`.hexplt`) files (for example /some_path/_ebPalettes/palettes). See _ebPalettes/setEBpalettesEnvVars.sh. If this environment variable is set, the script can look for a palette file name in that directory tree and render from it. See _ebPalettes/setEBpalettesEnvVars.sh.

# USAGE
# Run this script with the following parameters:
# - $1 A palette file in `.hexplt` format, which is a list of RGB colors expressed as hexadecimal (hex color codes), one color per line. If this file is in the directory you run this script from, it will be used. If the file is not in the current directory, it may be anywhere in a directory tree in a path given in the environment variable EB_PALETTES_ROOT_DIR, and the script will find the palette in that directory tree and render from it.
# - $2 OPTIONAL. Edge length of each square tile in final image. (Image width will be this X columns; image height will be this X rows.) If not provided a default is used. To use additional parameters and use the default for this, provide the string 'NULL' for this.
# - $3 OPTIONAL. If not provided, or provided as string 'NULL', the order of elements in the palette will be preserved. If provided and anything other than NULL (for example 2 or foo or 1 or 3), the script will randomly shuffle the hex color files before compositing them to one image. I have gone back and forth on requiring this in the history of this script :/
# - $4 OPTIONAL. Columns. If omitted, the script will try to come up with a number of columns that will best fit color tiles with minimal wasted gray "no color" remaining tiles. AND/OR, if columns and rows syntax is found in the source hexplt file (see NOTES) and you omit $4, it will use the columns and rows specified in the source hexplt.
# - $5 OPTIONAL. Rows. If omitted, the script will do math to make sure the needed number of rows are used to render all tiles with the given number of columns. At one point I wrote that if $5 was omitted, the script might do wrong math for the number of rows, but I don't see that being the case. If $5 is provided and is too small, the collage will be split vertically into truncated, numbered collages. I don't know why. Also, you can't use $5 unless you use $4.
# EXAMPLE COMMAND; create a palette image from the hex color list RGB_combos_of_255_127_and_0_repetition_allowed.hexplt, where each tile is a square 250px wide, the palette is 5 columns wide and 6 rows down, and tiles in the palette are rendered in random order:
#    renderHexPalette.sh RGB_combos_of_255_127_and_0_repetition_allowed.hexplt 250 foo 5 6
# ANOTHER EXAMPLE COMMAND; create a palette image from tigerDogRabbit_many_shades.hexplt, with each tile 300 pixels wide, no shuffling, the script deciding how many across and down to make the tiles:
#    renderHexPalette.sh tigerDogRabbit_many_shades.hexplt 300 tigerDogRabbit_many_shades.hexplt
# ANOTHER EXAMPLE COMMAND; use the same palette and let the script use all defaults, including any number of tiles (columns) accross and down specified in the source hexplt:
#    renderHexPalette.sh tigerDogRabbit_many_shades.hexplt
# NOTES
# - This script will work with many kinds of other information present in a .hexplt source file other than RGB hex codes. You can probably have any other arbitrary text, anywhere in the file, including on the same line as RGB hex codes, and it will extract and use only the RGB hex code information. However, no kinds of comments (like # or // at the start of lines) are supported.
# - Source hexplt files may contain syntax to define the desired number of columns and rows to render them with. The syntax is to write the word "columns" followed by a number on any line of the file, and optionally also the word "rows" followed by a number on any line of the file, like this:
#    columns 7 rows 8
# -- or like this:
#    #D29B7D columns 7, rows 8
# All that matters is that the word 'columns' appears followed by a number. You can specify columns only, and this script will figure out the needed number of rows. You can also specify rows (in which case the syntax is the keyword 'rows' followed by a number), and the script will use that number of rows, with the same conditions as for the number of tiles (rows) down parameters to this script.
# - I RECOMMEND that you specify the columns and rows as a comment after the first color in the palette, on the same line. This way, the `allRGBhexColorSort`~ scripts may be able to sort colors in palettes (it may not work if the columns and rows are specified on their own line).
# - If in a source hexplt file you specify (for example) "rows 4" but don't specify any columns, the script will interpret rows as the number of columns, and it may cut off tiles (not all color tiles will render). You must specify columns in the source hexplt file if you specify rows.


# CODE
# TO DO
# - implement e.g. -tile 8x40 flag depending on desired aspect, etc. (will determine values of $columns and $rows depending on desired aspect)?
# - Math to determine tile size dynamically for a target total image resolution?
