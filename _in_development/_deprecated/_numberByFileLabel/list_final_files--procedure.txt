Key: * = done. ! = in progress. All other listed tasks need doing.

*AGH! The following will fail wherever dimensions that include more than 5 digits (e.g. 12250x950) are in file names. The first thing it should do before the renaming step, therefore, is: it should open up to the user a list of all matched files, and prompt the user to screen them for erroneous matches and rename and "false positive" matches to not include those numbers.

To make use of this, art files which are finalized and ready for publication must be named beginning with _FINAL or _final (case doesn't matter). The script will sort and rename finalized works (so named) by date of creation.

(For the as-yet undescribed foldo mojo, that must also be _final_)

Any file name with the phrase _final in it but without a five-digit number in the filename will be renamed to include [optional label]_xxxxx (where xxxxx is a five-digit number that increments as a count of all final, sorted, publication-ready files.* The procedure for this follows.
		*NOTE: make it possible to pass the optional label to the program as an argument.
		*NOTE: make it possible to pass a folder to search through as an argument (for selective renaming by arbitrary criteria by the user).
PROCEDURE:
	* Precursor: search all folders and files in the given folder to match the regex [0-9]{5} (a five-digit number), add all matched folder and file names to an array, then bubble-sort the array to determine the highest five-digit number present in the files and folders.
	Search-and-rename procedure: search and index all files and subfolders in the given folder, by these criteria:
		In all these cases: IF the folder name does not match the regex [0-9]{5} AND the folder name includes the phrase _final_
	!  AND IF ALL file names within that folder do not match the regex [-_]{1}final[-_]{1} AND ALL file names do not match the regex [0-9]{5}
		ADD THEM TO THE INDEX, including file creation time (a value/key index?).
		-
		In all these cases: IF the folder name does not match the regex [0-9]{5} AND the folder name does not include the phrase _final AND any file in the folder does not match the regex [0-9]{5} and matches the regex [-_]{1}final[-_]{1}
		ADD THEM TO THE INDEX (only add file names, not folders.)
	Renaming procedure:
		Sort the matched filenames index by creation date, oldest first, and
			Rename them sequentially after the last highest available five-digit number, including any optional user-specified label, e.g. ~_abstraction_xxxxx (where xxxxx is the next higher number) -- BUT do not number and rename any files that include the labels variant, variation, var, alternate, or alt.
				FOR NOW, rename the folders by hand to match the renamed files, by the highest number of all renamed files.
				TO DO: add an algorithm that auto-renames the parent folders of so many renamed files.
				TO DO: also make it create new folder names for renamed files that are in the given (root search) folder.

Art that doubles as resources for other art and as standalone art should be . . . placed in subfolders named _RESOURCES?
